        <article>Your land is the foundation of your off grid life. To go off grid, you need a parcel of land that lends itself to your new lifestyle choice. That usually means finding land in a remote area, far from strict building codes and permitting regulations. Land in these areas is less expensive, property taxes are lower, and you can get more acreage for your money.</article>

            Access to water: Climate: living off grid in a harsh or extreme climate can be challenging, so make sure you're prepared for the weather. Soil quality: if you plan to grow your own food, it is important to assess the soil quality of the land, or at least make sure the property has space.</aside>
